			<br>Chemistry at SIUE offers many exciting possibilities for both undergraduates and students seeking the Master of Science degree. The Department and SIUE are committed both to quality education and to creative scholarship. Both undergraduate and graduate students are strongly encouraged to work with faculty in research projects and other scholarship. The department has 20 faculty, offers an American Chemical Society-certified undergraduate program, and has ~100 majors and ~30 M.S. students. Students may choose from eight undergraduate degree programs (see Undergraduate Handbook on left menu) and a thesis or non-thesis M.S. degree program.<br><br>
			We are well equipped for a midsize non-Ph.D. department (see equipment on department menu), and all equipment is available both to undergraduate and graduate students.
