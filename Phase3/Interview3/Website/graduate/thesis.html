  		<h1>Theses and Dissertations</h1>
<p class="text"><br>A thesis or dissertation is an original work based on original research by <br>you, the student. It is a significant undertaking, but the end result <br>should be a contribution to humanityâ€™s knowledge. You should be guided in <br>your work by a graduate faculty committee made up of a chair and at least <br>two other members. Choose your committee chair and members to provide <br>expertise and guidance in your subject matter.<br><br></div>
