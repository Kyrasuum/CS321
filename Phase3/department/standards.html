              <li>Grades of “C” or better in CHEM121a and CHEM121b are required of all Chemistry majors before proceeding into any chemistry courses numbered above 199. Transfer students, upper-division students and others who have not earned a grade of “C” or better in CHEM 121 will be required to do so as a condition for being accepted as a major in Chemistry.</li><br>
              <li>No more than 8 semester hours of “D” in any science or mathematics courses may be counted toward a major in Chemistry.</li><br>

          <li>Students are required to present a poster (with a 10-15 minute oral presentation and defense) or a PowerPoint presentation.</li><br>
          <li>Students are encouraged to present results from their own research projects. Otherwise topics from the chemical literature may be presented.</li><br>
          <li>All topics are pre-approved by the instructor and/or the Student Standards and Assessment Committee.</li><br>
          <li>All students are expected to do library work and gather and evaluate the information obtained.</li><br>
          <li>All departmental faculty are responsible for evaluating the resulting projects.</li><br>
