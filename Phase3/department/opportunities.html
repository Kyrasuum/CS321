          <h3>Opportunities in Chemistry</h3>
          <h4>General Career Outlook</h4>
          <p>
            Many opportunities in a wide variety of fields are open to a person with a chemistry background.  Chemists work as analysts, environmentalists, criminologists, librarians, patent examiners, production foremen, researchers, teachers and writers. They work for companies that produce everyday needs such as fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, plastics, processed foods and semi-conductors; for governmental laboratories federal, state and local; in sales; for hospitals; and for high schools, colleges, and universities.

          <p>
            Employment rates among degreed chemists have been about half the unemployment rate of the general population. In 2013, the overall unemployment rate amongst Chemists surveyed by the American Chemical Society was 3.4%. This rate is above the usual rate of 2% during relatively good economic times.

          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, the median annual salaries for chemists were: $73.3K (B.S degree); $88.7K (M.S.) and $102.2K (Ph.D.). Starting salaries in industry for inexperienced B.S. graduates range from $26,000 to $45,000. Prospects appear bright for employment and salary increases.

          <h4>Chemistry in Industry</h4>
          <p>
            More than 60% of all chemists work in private industry. Some conduct research, applying scientific knowledge to the manufacture of new and improved materials. Others in industry are directly involved in on-line production, manufacturing millions of tons of a high-quality product according to a detailed production schedule and budget. Such products might be fertilizers, herbicides, drugs, synthetic fibers, polymers or steels. Other chemists verily the quality of the products, advertise them, call on potential users or apply for a patent. The health and safety of workers in the plant and the potential harm of waste products also may be the responsibility of chemists. Information processing, technical writing and plant management are other industrial positions in which chemists may be found. Some even become the company president.
