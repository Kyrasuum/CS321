        <b>It has been, and will remain, the policy of the Department of Chemistry that a student may be removed from a class list and be replaced with persons on the wait list at the beginning of the first laboratory period.</b>

        <li>At the beginning of the first lab period, the Department's lab manager organizes the students present in teams of two using waitlisted students if registered students are not present.</li><br>
        <li>At this point, for safety concerns, anyone on the wait list who has not gained access to the lab is asked to leave.</li><br>
        <li>The lab manager then assigns Lab kits to the students in courses that uses kits (note: General Chemistry no longer uses kits).  The Lab kits are checked and signed off by the student for completeness and safety.</li><br>
        <li>The lab manager then initiates departmental, University, state, and federally mandated safety training.</li><br><br>
        <li>Immediately following the training, students are must sign off that they have been made aware of the safety issues when taking a laboratory course.</li><br>
        <li>The above tasks for the lab manager are exacerbated by the fact that the lab manager is attempting this task in multiple, simultaneously run lab sections.</li><br>
        <li>In addition, after the described activities, most lab sections are then required to complete their first laboratory experiment in the time remaining. For the reasons described above, and the fact that the order of what needs to be accomplished and when are unalterable, the Department has the following policy on attendance of the first laboratory class:</li>
