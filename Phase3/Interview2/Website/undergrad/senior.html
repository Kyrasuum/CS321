      <h4>
        As they approach graduation it is expected that baccalaureate students in Chemistry will:
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Manifest an understanding of those fundamental chemical principles and practices suggested by the American Chemical Society Committee on Professional Training.
        </li>
        <li>
          Demonstrate the applicability of chemical principles and practices in the study and understanding of other fields while recognizing the unifying aspects of knowledge regardless of fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be prepared for graduate study in chemistry and/or related professional fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be able to compete successfully for entry-level employment in chemistry or related areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be able to communicate orally and in writing about the impact of chemistry in society, historical advances in chemistry, and ethical issues in chemistry.
        </li>

      <h4>
        The senior assignment is a student's opportunity to demonstrate to faculty, fellow students, and others that the student has achieved these goals. Students are required to present either a poster (with a 10-15 minute oral presentation and defense) or a 20-30 minute Power Point seminar.
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Students are encouraged to present results from their own research experiences. Students who have not taken advantage of the opportunity to do research with a faculty member will present a "library project" based on the chemical literature.
        </li>
        <li>
          All topics are approved by the course instructor and/or the Student Standards and Assessment Committee.
        </li>
        <li>
          All students are expected to do library work and gather and evaluate the information obtained.
        </li>
        <li>
          All departmental faculty are responsible for evaluating the resulting projects.
        </li>
