      <p>
        Student research is an important part of chemistry graduate student life at SIUE. BS Chemistry and Biochemistry majors take at least three credit-hours of Undergraduate Research or Senior Honors Research during their junior or senior years. Research projects may last from 6 months to 2 years, and focus on research in a particular faculty memberâ€™s lab.

        Many of our faculty are funded by external research grants. Graduates can post the results of their research here on this site along with their faculty supervisors during their research.
