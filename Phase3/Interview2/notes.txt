Interview 2:
Chemistry intro could be made bigger.  The news/events is overkill in size.
Interviewer thinks Intro page feels chemistry specific so dont change it.
Equipment isnt obvious that it would be under department info.  Maybe rethinking its placement would be good?
The carousel still isnt obvious in its function.  Maybe some arrows or some interactive change?
The faculty list page has an intense amount of blue.  Breaking it up would help the user.
More clarity in presenting the information that this is a sample cirriculum and any choices of classes would be really nice.
Cirriculum requirements should be setup similarly to sample cirriculum and replace it as the default page for course info.
A general resources tab might be helpful containing equipment, tutoring, and resources
Tutoring page has a large amount of blue, breaking it up would help
The text itself is too compressed, add some seperation
Senior Assignment page could use some pictures, some dropdown to hide the text at start, and some numbering on the items.
The inconsistency in the pictures for opportunities in chemistry is annoying.  The side navbar could be made smaller.  The text should be broken up to be more like captions on a picture in their own boxes.
The advising page could use a clear link to setting up an appointment.
Overall try to break up the blue and add clarity that links are infact links.
