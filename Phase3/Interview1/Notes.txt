Interviewer: Sam
Observer: Justin

Interview 1 notes:

make homescreen pop and stand out.  There needs to be more color.
It needs more clarity on faculty list page that the carousel selects different people.
The filter could use an option to filter by department or 'niche'.
Advisors page needs more colors.
Interviewee went to faculty list first when looking for tutoring.  Including tutors as faculty?
Tutoring page tables needs some alteration or seperation to make it easier to find info.  Maybe different colors by name.
Tutoring page could use some narrowing of information so that there is more spread vertically rather than horizontally.
Financial aid page could be converted from a link into a dropdown message displaying information about the awards and scholarships.
Courses page color scheme is pretty harsh.  Maybe a softening similar to tutoring colors might be preferable.
Less white overall is prefereable on the pages.
Opportunities in Chemistry page could benefit from the text and image being centered.
A background image is prefered to eliminate the white on the pages.
Research page limits the topics to existing topics which is nice instead of anything where you have to think of the keyword yourself.
The map on contact us could be smaller.  It can be a little too much in your face.
Resources page needs more color.
Pages feels like they are being elongated just to fill the screen.  Include some text in order to fill the screen.
Change navbar image or change font color/button color.

Thoughts:
For advisors page add 'last name' to the "Advisor for:A-K"
Add uniformity in style with 3 colors
Add a background image/color for every page
Nav buttons could be shrunk
Make the map navigation a bar like the others
