	make sure the names of the faculty are on their picture
	Both work but the carousel is neat

	Was going to say something about adding requirments but found the link
	Likes the requirements being on a seperate page to prevent lots of scrolling
	overall likes the page
Degree Programs
	Likes having the more detailed list of classes when clicking on the course curiculum
	Thinks the link to the proffessors page is nice to have as a quick link to contact them
Contact Us
	Nothing needs to be added
	The map could be moved to a seperate page
	
Overall
	Maybe add some kind of periodic table picture or something like that
	Add some pictures/color to the site to sprouse it up
